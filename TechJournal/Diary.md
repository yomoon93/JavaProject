# Diary Entry 11/7/22

Last week when we found out about our teams we spoke about our strengths and weaknesses.
Now that we have the assignment we are brainstorming how to go about the project and how to distribute the assignments. We started by having a diagram of the classes we have to create with methods that are going to be needed. We also spoke about what optional we want to aim for just so we have a goal that we all can agree on. Overall the mood is happy and we are excited for this project. Side note i started the react and made boilerplate code for it. We ended up working and basically finishing all the classes, we will be working on doa classes apart from the classes.

We accomplished a lot yesterday, we did a lot of coding i started 
the react bolier code, and i created the account class that still 
needs some code to be fixec but the basics are there. The springboot 
was started we are all doing our specific DOA so we can test it through 
springboot so we can get closer to testing the endpoints. I plan on doing 
some testing for the methods i created, finshing more of the springboot and 
talking to the team to see what else we need.

We started by checking in with the group 
and seeing where everyone was at. After we 
checked to see what things need to be done so our 
work can be done. Today im going to create the reference 
from customer to check if the customer exists so i could 
create the account. I also created some methods that my 
partners need. I felt stuck trying to think about how to 
reference another piece of data but i made it work at the 
end.

I started by having a meeting with the team before going into our standup, 
and we spoke about our merge conflicts we had and what we needed to do for the day 
i kept working on my addAccount method where I added to something that checked to see 
if a customer exists then create the account. I also spoke to mazid because he had a couple 
of things that weren't going to work. But overall what i'm doing today is fixing my code so when i create a 
account the customer gets referenced.

Today i started by going through the flow of my classes to 
see what else was needed for this project i checked with 
marek to see if the way i'm connecting customer to account was the right way.
After i worked on my account to add certain accounts to my list of used accounts. 
I also took a minute to think about how close method works and what it should be doing when we delete an account

We started our day by having a meeting and talking about what we needed from everyone today, we also spoke about the questions we would have when it came to working with the UI.
We asked some questions to Marek about the flow of the code and what needed to happen for it work how we wanted to work. I messes up on friday not pushing what i had done and im paying for it now. 
But i didn't push it because i was working on everyone stuff and i didn't want to have any merge conflicts. I added the rest of the methods and the deletemapping to my account now i'm helping my teammates with whatever they need.

# Diary Entry 11/15/22
I started by my day by working on fixing my methods and my endpoints, I helped Mazid with the rest of his customer classes, thereafter we tested the rest of our endpoints to make sure they are working correctly.
Once done working with the endpoints I tried helping Julian with his transaction classes we worked out the thing's that needed to change and things that would work in the controller. 

# Diary Entry 11/16/22

Today we started by trying to solve some of the issues that we had with the UI because some of 
our information wasn't showing up. Which led me to change a lot of the variables and made my code 
that once work not work at all. Once getting help rom Charlie we were able to fix my problems and 
somehow in fixing that it fixed the UI. Which still led me in the path of trying to figure out what 
i had done wrong. At the end i figured out that the variable and the getters had to be the same name. 
I was able to solve the problem and also understand how springboot works and how everything gets connected
to the UI. I also started working on some test, but i focused on the presentation.

# Diary Entry 11/17/22
I started typing up the readme for the project and also did some testing last night so i didnt have to do some 
much for the last day. I'm spending the day testing the endpoints and the localAccountDAO methods that i have. 
Thereafter i will be adding to my powerpoint presentation. At the end we finished everything i finsihed adding 
to the readme. I will also be trying to do the docker portion of the extra credit. But it was a good day and im 
happy for the team
